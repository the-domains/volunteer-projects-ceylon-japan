  VPC is an innovative and leading charity organisation devoted to providing
  life-changing placements in Sri Lanka for overseas volunteers.


  Bringing together the different talents of highly experienced and
  award-winning charity professionals who have worked in the field for over 20
  years, we have created a charity team who are truly passionate about social
  and community development. Since its very first day, VPC has striven to place
  people at the heart of all we do: from our multi-national and multi-talented
  volunteers who change people's lives on a daily basis, to the many communities
  whose lives are changed.


  We believe that by working together, regardless of age, gender, nationality or
  social background, we can create the richest of experiences, develop valuable
  knowledge and skills through complete cultural immersion. Above all else,
  though, each of us is relentless in our mission to offer hope and opportunity
  for those people in communities who need it most – and each and every day we
  feel immensely proud of our volunteers' tireless work towards achieving our
  mission.
